Title: BibTool: A Tool to Manipulate BibTeX Files
Author: Gerd Neugebauer
Abstract: BibTEX provides an easy to use means to integrate citations
 and bibliographies into LaTeX documents. But the user is left alone
 with the management of the BibTeX files. The program BibTool is intended
 to fill this gap. BibTool allows the manipulation of BibTeX files which
 goes beyond the possibilities -- and intentions -- of BibTeX.
 The possibilities of BibTool include sorting and merging of BibTeX data
 bases, generation of uniform reference keys, and selecting of references
 used in a publication.
