# iCaRL PyTorch implementation

This is not the official iCaRL code. The original Theano-Lasagne code for the CIFAR-100 experiments can be found in the [official repo](https://github.com/srebuffi/iCaRL).

Our iCaRL is based on this [pytorch implementation](https://github.com/lrzpellegrini/icarl-pytorch)  

This implementation has been tested with Python 3.8.6 and PyTorch 1.7.1 (see the [conda environment](environment.yml) for more details).
